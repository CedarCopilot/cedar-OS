description: 'An open-source framework for building the next generation of AI native software'
---

Cedar-OS is a open-source framework for building AI-native react apps. Basically, it helps your app go from vscode to cursor.

Cedar-OS is trusted by indie developers & 5+ YC companies, and comes from months of implementing AI copilots in production applications.

We believe the future of AI isn't just a chatbot on the side, but something that's aware of what's going on inside the app, can directly change local state, and working tightly with the user and software to provide value.
For the first time in history, products can come to life. We want to help you build something with life.
